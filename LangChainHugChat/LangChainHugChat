Certainly! I'll create a multi-page Streamlit script using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that incorporates the features you've requested. This script will allow loading UTF-8 documents, use a LangChain multi-step chain with a HugChat Chatbot, and include a FAISS vectorstore with various retrievers.

Let's break this down into multiple classes and create a Streamlit app to tie it all together. I'll create an artifact for the main script, and we can discuss the implementation details afterward.


This script creates a Streamlit application that incorporates the following components:

1. `DocumentLoader`: Handles loading and splitting documents of various types (Python, text, PDF, HTML, and Word documents).
2. `VectorStoreManager`: Manages the FAISS vectorstore and provides different retriever options.
3. `LLMChatBot`: Implements the HugChat chatbot with login functionality.
4. `DocumentChatbot`: Combines the LLMChatBot and VectorStoreManager to create a conversational retrieval chain.
5. `StreamlitApp`: The main application class that ties everything together and creates the user interface.

To run this application:

1. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install streamlit langchain hugchat faiss-cpu transformers sentence-transformers TTS
```

2. Save the script as `app.py` and run it with:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

This application allows users to:
- Upload documents (txt, pdf, py, html, docx)
- Log in to HuggingFace
- Chat with the uploaded documents using the HugChat-based chatbot

The application uses a FAISS vectorstore for efficient document retrieval and a ConversationalRetrievalChain for maintaining context in the conversation.

Note that this is a basic implementation and may require further refinement and error handling for production use. Also, make sure to handle the HuggingFace credentials securely in a production environment.

Is there anything specific you'd like me to explain or modify in this implementation?
